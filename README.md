## Title
TimeDrift:Echoes of Eternity - Learning History in VR for dyslexics
## Overview
  Our product prototype is a VR educational game designed to help users (especially dyslexic users) learn history in an immersive and engaging way. By harnessing the power of VR technology, we provide users with an interactive experience that reduces reliance on text and makes learning more accessible. The game places users in historically accurate virtual environments, allowing them to explore ancient civilisations such as Rome through visual and auditory storytelling with minimal text. This approach helps dyslexic users engage with historical content in a more intuitive and relaxed way, utilising visual cues and interactions as an alternative to traditional reading methods.
